# VBA_Manager

VBA_Manager builds VBA code from several small bean files (such as one function/method) and imports it into a VBA application.
The bean files are plain text files and is suitable for management with git, and so on.
VBA_Manager provides functions that make development convenient for users, 
such as automatically generating code by analyzing CodeModule from VBA_Manager-specific comments written in the source code such as global variables and user menus.
After the release, it can be used as a general application without the VBA_Manager.
